# JAGS-examples
Some example Bayesian models and simulations in the JAGS language

Step 1: First download JAGS from http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/

Step 2: Open R or RStudio and install the relevant MCMC and JAGS packages: coda, stats4, runjags, and segemented (for simulation 2).

Other useful packages for this include ggplot2, MASS, and rjags.

Step 3: read the introductory powerpoint file that loosely goes over Bayesian, MCMC, and applications

Step 4: Run the various .R simulation files

  Simulation 1.R goes over simple linear regression

  Simulation 2.R goes over a breakpoint analysis

  Simulation 3.R goes over a hierarchical model

Step 5: have fun
